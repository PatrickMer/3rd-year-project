# Demo Frontend

## Overview
This is a preliminary website created for testing API functionality during the early development stages of the project. It is not intended for use in the final product and served purely as a developmental step.

## Purpose
- Test API connections with the backend services
- Verify data flow and response handling
- Prototype basic UI interactions
- Validate integration points with Langflow

## Development Context
This test harness was built using React, TypeScript, and Vite to quickly scaffold a functional frontend that could make API calls. It allowed for rapid iteration while developing the core functionality before implementing the proper UI in the final application.

## Usage Note
This code is maintained for reference purposes only. For the actual implementation, please refer to the main application code in the project.

## Setup (For Reference Only)
If you need to run this test frontend:

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

3. Make sure the required backend services are running before testing API calls.

## Project Structure
- Basic React + TypeScript setup using Vite
- Minimal UI elements focused on functionality rather than design
- API service modules for testing backend connectivity
